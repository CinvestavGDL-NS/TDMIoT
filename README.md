# TDMIoT
## Taxonomy for Decision Making under uncertainty in IoT systems.


TDMIoT is a taxonomy of decision-making processes that addresses the selection of algorithmic solutions for IoT applications. TDMIoT has a hierarchical structure and was designed using a conceptual-empirical approach. In other words, the categories within the dimensions originate from the review of the literature in different disciplines of computer science and were selected through the analysis of works as part of a systematic review in the field of IoT. 
Each dimension in this taxonomy represents a characteristic of the decision process. This taxonomy is intended as a guide for the selection of decision-making algorithms and attempts to find relationships between the elements associated with the decision-making process, the purpose of the decision problem, and the decision-making algorithms. 
The analysis for the definition of the TDMIoT characteristics is based on an Input-Process-Output model.
